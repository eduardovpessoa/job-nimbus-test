### Problem 1:

Write a method that takes a string argument and returns whether or not characters in the string have matching brackets. Meaning for every { there is a corresponding } bracket. Return true if they do, return false if they do not. Please unit test with the following use cases (and any others you choose to ensure functionality):

Test string - Expected result

{} - True

}{ - False (closed bracket can't proceed all open brackets.)

{{} - False (one bracket pair was not closed)

"" - True. (no brackets in the string will return True)

### Problem 2:

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

For example, if we sum all multiples of 3 or 5 below 10, we would get 3, 5, 6, and 9 and the sum of these multiples is 23.
